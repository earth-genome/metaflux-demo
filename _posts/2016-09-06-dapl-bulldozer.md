On Tuesday, a federal judge in Washington, D.C. halted construction on a portion of the contentious Dakota Access Bakken oil pipeline route, which falls on federal land. However, because the court lacked jurisdiction, he ruled that construction could continue on the area* that the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe had recently identified as sacred tribal burial ground, a site that was bulldozed over the Labor Day weekend by pipeline construction crews. -- [Desmog](https://www.desmogblog.com/2016/09/06/dakota-access-pipeline-sacred-sites-federal-judge)
