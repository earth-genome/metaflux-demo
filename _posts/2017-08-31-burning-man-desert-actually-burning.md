Despite the dust, the Burning Man party keeps going in the Black Rock Desert of northern Nevada. The main route into Burning Man was closed Wednesday night because of a rapidly expanding wildfire but reopened Thursday. The spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management, John Gaffney, said the lightning-caused Tohakum 2 Fire remained at "30,000 plus acres" — almost 50 square miles — overnight. Officials have no word yet on when it will be contained. -- [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/08/30/wildfire-closes-main-route-between-reno-burning-man/619363001/)
