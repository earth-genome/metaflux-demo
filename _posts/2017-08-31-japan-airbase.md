Two U.S. B-1B supersonic bombers from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam and four U.S. F-35 stealth fighter jets from the Marine Corps Air Station in Iwakuni, Japan, joined four South Korean jets and two Japanese warplanes for the exercises Wednesday. It was a direct response to North Koreaâ€™s launch of an intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan on Tuesday, the U.S. Pacific Command said in a statement Thursday. -- [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/08/31/u-s-south-korean-and-japanese-warplanes-carry-out-show-force-against-north-korea/619561001/)
