Zaatari is a refugee camp in Jordan, located 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) east of Mafraq which is gradually evolving into a permanent settlement. It was first opened on July 28, 2012 to host Syrians fleeing the violence in the ongoing Syrian civil war that erupted in 2011. On March 26, 2015, the camp population was estimated at 83,000 refugees. The footprint of the camp in 2017 was 2.04 square miles, as measured by satellite imagery.  -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaatari_refugee_camp) and Block Orbit.
