Over $400 million have been spent on the State Correctional Institution Phoenix in Pennsylvania.  As of April 2016, it still had not opened.  The prison footprint is 96.53 acres to house 3,872 inmates, meant to extend the 87-year-old Graterford prison. -- [Philadelphia Inquirer](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/inq-phillydeals/Pas-most-costly-prison-400-days-late-Quality-product-or-Struggling.html)
