[Global Forest Watch](http://www.globalforestwatch.org) tracks deforestation from satellite imagery.  This is a top down approach to monitoring.  There is also the capability to source local information by revealed activity of users.  For example, users of GFW have been very interested in this area in Peru, which has seen a recent expansion in either mining or industrial activity.  The forest clearing activiy may be illegal or notable for some other reason that only the nearby communities are able to know.  No matter what, this area is newsworthy for some reason.
