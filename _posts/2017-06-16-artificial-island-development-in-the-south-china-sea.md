China appears to have largely completed major construction of military infrastructure on artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea and can now deploy combat planes and other military hardware there at any time. The footprint in 2015 of Spratly Island was approximately 163,700 square feet. By June 2017, it had grown to 375,200 square feet. -- [Reuters](www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-china-spratlys-idUSKBN16Z005)
