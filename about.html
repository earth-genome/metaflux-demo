        <p><b class="poppins">Metaflux</b> is a joint project of the <a href="https://www.earthgenome.org" target="_blank">Earth Genome</a> and <a href="http://www.dailyoverview.com/" target="_blank">Daily Overview</a>. The Earth Genome builds tools and technology that translates big environmental data into actionable insight. Daily Overview publishes satellite imagery of the places and moments where human activity has shaped the landscape. Together, our objective is to expose newsworthy stories that can be materially enhanced with satellite imagery -- and consumed alongside the daily news.</p>

        <h2 class="ui header">Independent, credible, and globally consistent reporting from space.</h2>

        <p> There is nothing more unbiased than images taken from a satellite hurdling at 18,000 miles per hour, 1,200 miles above the Earth's surface.  Maybe my mom.  She's unbiased when she says I'm the most handsome man alive.  The hardware in space represents billions of dollars of investment, mainly to service the defense and intelligence industry.  The objective of Metaflux is to repurpose that investment for broader social applications.  Specifically, the objectice of Metaflux is to enhance, validate, and contextualize news reporting.  </p>

        <p>The first stage of this project is to generate an automatic feed of stories from satellite imagery.  Reporters can reuse and repurpose the content for their own stories.  All the while, we will continue to assist readers to better engage with this relatively new medium. If you have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to <a href="{{ "/contact/" | relative_url}}">reach out to us</a>.</p>
